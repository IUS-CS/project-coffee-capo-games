# Project Reflections

## Nathan Tate
My main role for the Arachnivania project was pixel artist. Since this was definitlely more of an artistic role, I spent a lot of my working time in photo editors rather than text editors. The first 2 sprints were a major test for me because I am not the most visually artistic person and I had to learn to use these new pixel art tools from no major experience, but I have always wanted to get into pixel art and this project was a great way to just dive in. The first task that I undertook was to define the main aesthetic and backgrounds for the game. This started with many videos from pixel artists all over the internet and hours of drawing and erasing and drawing some more. My second major task that I had was to animate the main player character. This had to be done for our first prototype as well as the actual main game files once we scrapped the prototype. This involved modifying our existing spider asset and arranging it to have out 8 frames to be played as our walking animation. My third major task was to create the main menu UI and implement that into our prototype main menu. While this was easier than learning the animation, the font work took a while to get just but I think the end result looks good and meshes well with the rest of the game. From a Agile/Scrum perspective, my team at my day job practices a Scrum methodology and so I am very familiar with the format and the benefits. I think using the Scrum method was a good choice for this project and our team, (while all of us are on different schedules), was able to adapt well and make efficient use of the Scrum process.
