## Planning
  
Points | Story
-------|--------
5| As a user, I want a character with detailed animations that increase immersion and are predictable to me as a player.
4| As a user, I want... a game that looks good and has a consistent aesthetic that sets a good tone and mood for the game.
3| As an administrator, I want to finish developing the models for the playable     character and enemy designs ... so I can continue to create a game that is consistent and functional.  
7| As an administrator, I want to build levels with miniature objective that guide the player through the levels to create a cohesive and sequential experience.
3| As an administrator, I want to build a game detailed level transititions that move the player through the game seamlessly.
6| As an administrator I want to build a game with all of the basic functionality of modern games, including menus, pausing, and a score system.
