# Arachnivania

This project is a Godot-powered game.

## Vision

Arachnivania is a 2D Metroidvania style platformer that will focus on exploring, puzzlesolving and key hunting with some light combat. Current games similar to it are Hollow Knight and Celeste.

## Description

In Arachnivania you play as a spider trying to protect its burrow from invading Wasps. In the process you will discover new ways to fighe and avoid enemies while trying to safe guard your burrow.

## Story

You are a Spider trying to take down an invading Wasp nest that is a threat to your burrow and eggs. You will need to better fortify your burrow in the process. You will learn how to cartwheel, use your web like a grappling hook and even create decoys out of dead insects and webbing. You will even learn how to disable opponents by shooting hairs in their eyes, or shoot venom at them.
