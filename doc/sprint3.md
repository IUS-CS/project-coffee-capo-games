## Retro
  
[What is a Sprint Retrospective](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-sprint-retrospective)
  
### Good
  
* The team is getting better and planning tasks and objectives and making use of the project board to better complete tasks
* No merge conflicts in sprint 3
* The team is learning how to effectively use the tools used to write the game code and create the game assets

### Bad
  
* Overlaps in planning caused bottlenecks in team members completing work, some team members were waiting on others in order to complete their tasks
* Map design workflow could use more structure in order to make the process of designing levels
  
### Actionable Commitments
  
* As a team, we will reduce task overlap in order to prevent members from needing to wait to on others to comeplete their tasks
* As a team, we will create better organized task items that fit the role of the teammates assigned
